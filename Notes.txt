Assets for Pudge Wars

-- Living Stuff --
Player Sprite
-A Cowboy on a Pony
-Cowboy is wearing a cowboy hat so you don't see their body (or maybe you do, or at least part of it)
-Animation Needed (4-8 frame)

Cow Sprite (Still Pending Implementation)
-A cow.
-Animation Needed (2-8 frames)

-- Level / World --
Grass Tiles
-Grass. It's simple.
-A couple of different versions (3+) of tiles to break the grid-layout.
-I just had this idea to animate the grass a little bit (I can do this actually)
	-Each tile will randomly update after a random amount of time to make it look like the grass is swaying (?)

Fence Tiles
-Fence to separate the two sides from each other.
-Only one is really needed, unless you want to make it so that some fences are beaten up (or simply different), thats cool too.

Center Area Thing
-Possibly have a stream of water going down the center
-Only one set is really needed, but it will be animated.
	-What I am going to do is have each tile be the same, but I will animate them at different times giving the illusion of movement.
	-Please note that the animations might not need to be coherent, meaning frame A does not necessarily need to be followed by frame B.
		- The animation will probably be random so frames may go like 2-4-3-1-2-3-4. Hence, don't make the different animations coherent.

Center Healing Thing
-Possibly a Hay-Bail? Giant Tree with Apples?
